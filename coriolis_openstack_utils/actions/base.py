""" This module defines the base ABC for all `Action`s performed by the various
utility commands.
Each action should hold the self-contained logic for its pariticular resource
type (ex: recreating a secgroups, triggering Coriolis migrations, etc...), as
well as contain logic for checking if the action is already completed, and
logic for rolling back an action.
The various `Action` classes should be arranged into a logical tree of actions
and they should be excuted in a "leaf-first"-type traversal.
